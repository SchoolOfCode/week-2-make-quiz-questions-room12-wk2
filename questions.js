    correct_explanation: `In the Dreamer room there are no wrong answers so you can come up with lots of ideas.
                           The Realist room is where you narrow them down to what you can realistically do.
                           The Critic room is where you look at it from all angles and pick holes in ideas.
                           The Swimming Room is a pool, probably.`,
